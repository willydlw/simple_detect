# ROS Package - simple_detect

The simple_detect package includes programs to aid in detecting objects. It is currently in development to use non-machine learning capabilities of opencv.


## Program Description and Usage


### hsv_sliders.py

Description: Thresholding Operations using inRange and the HSV color space

The OpenCV inRange function applies upper and lower boundary values to the source image pixels. The pixels within this range are set to 255. Pixels outside the range are set to 0.

The program works with either camera input or still image input. For camera input, uncomment the line `ret, frame = cap.read()` and comment out the section starting at `path = ` through `print('imread failure')` in the try except block.

When working with a still image, change the path to the location of your still image.

```
while True:

    # Uncomment the line below for camera input
    #ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    
    # To use with a single still image, uncomment this section.
    # Change the path to your image path.
    
    path = '../images/angled_backpack1.png'

    try:
        # Reading an image in default mode 
        frame = cv.imread(path)
    except cv.error as e:
        print('imread failure') 
```


Program execution: `python hsv_sliders.py`

The image below was generated by moving the sliders. Note that the maximum value of the Hue slider is 180, due to the way OpenCV represents the HSV color space.<br><br><br>
